In 1980, LA City Council formally recognized Koreatown as a section of the city of Los Angeles, allocating the areas between Vermont Avenue, Western Avenue, Third Street, and Olympic as the Korean hub in the Los Angeles County. Koreans had been migrating to the states for many years prior, but with the formal recognition, Koreatown became ingrained into the dynamics of Los Angeles. In the past, Koreatown has been a very fragmented and racially divided area, with Koreans believing that only those that looked like them were seen on equal footing which can be seen through the artwork in the early 90s. However, the Koreatown of today is a modern hub that has undergone a radical change, expanding in diversity and acceptance as a result of the changing urban landscape, the exodus of the more prosperous Korean-Americans which has been replaced with an influx of millenials, and the diffusion of Korean culture that has swept the globe. 
	The presence of Korean-Americans was once that of a proud and exclusive group. With the memory of Japanese internment, the Korean War, and migrational restrictions by the US fresh in their minds, ethnic homogeneity was one truth that many Korean immigrants held as they began to build better lives for themselves and their posterity. The co-mingling of other nationalities at the same level of respect in a social setting was discouraged as Koreans’ trust for any ethnicity that was not their own had vanished. In the 1900’s, there were many murals commissioned to liven up the city that had just been torn down by the Rodney King Riots. There are two murals, one done by a Japanese-American and Chinese American, another done by a Korean American, whose comparison reveals quite a bit about the Korean mindset in the past and provides context for the change that has been going on in recent years.
	The first mural, “Remember Your Roots” (shown below) was created by Tony Osumi and Darryl Mar in 1994. The two were UCLA graduates studying Asian American studies and had little contact with Koreantown prior, but were tasked with envisioning the soul of Koreatown within a mural. Original they planned to focus on the heritage of Koreans, but when they interacted with the community, they found a much more diverse narrative where Korean-American children openly played with Latino-American and African-American children and “they discovered that Koreatown isn't just for Korean Americans” (LA Times Leslie Berestein). This led to the creation of a mural that incorporated the inspiration of Korean heritage along with the true representation of the community, bringing together multiple races and generations that are true indications of Koreatown’s populace.
