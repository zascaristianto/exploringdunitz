Another Friday night of my friends and I contemplating what to do, deciding whether to go see a movie like last week or eat at one of the same three restaurants we go to every weekend. Another night brainstorming places to go to meet new people or experience new activities. Time and time again, we gave up and defaulted to dinner and a movie at someone’s house. Growing up in suburbia tends to be portrayed as an idyllic life: open spaces for children to play in, comfortable, similar structured houses located near schools, and a consistent ethos among the residents. However, these are the same elements that lead to a monotonous, mundane life. Suburban neighborhoods, such as North Hollywood, offer cultural stability, but the social isolation leads to boredom that can result in a homogenous culture that lacks a community outlet. The key elements of suburban areas are determined by the inhabitants, the distinction between suburban and other types of living areas, and how commerce is distributed among the community. The homogeny creates a false sense of order within the community but on surface level, fails to address the different cultures within the community. Mental health can be impacted negatively due to the lack of outlets within the community, influencing young people to turn to drugs and crime. Art is a typical outlet that uses creativity to release emotions and stress. However, in the North Hollywood area, the art on display does not reflect a sense of community.

Upon closer examination of the people of North Hollywood, the illusion of homogeneity is disproven. Those just passing by the community may think that it is a rather uniform society solely based on the similar home structure and little to no visible diversity. Yet as we walked around the residential areas into the main road of commerce, I noticed the signage that appeared at every corner. From Spanish, to Greek, to English, stores provided a variety of languages for different customers. The racial/ethnic makeup of North Hollywood is 53.4% Hispanic, 31.3% White, 6.7% Asian, and 6.1% Black” (Race and Ethnicity). As one can infer from the data, the population of North Hollywood is a mix of people. While Hispanics and whites are the most abundant ethnicities, no one population comprises 80% or more of the entire community, which means this is a heterogenous culture. When interviewing a couple on their daily walk, they informed us that they had immigrated to North Hollywood from Armenia. Although not born in the United States, those who live in this community tend to take on the stereotypical suburban lifestyle. Those who come from other countries are expected to integrate into the American culture. This causes a contradiction because America has always prided itself on being a heterogenous society, accepting of all religions and ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, assimilation is expected in order to maintain the illusion homogeneity of the suburb.
In order to fully understand Suburban communities, one needs to establish the how they are classified. Walking around in New York City it is clear you are in an urban environment and not the rural countryside of Idaho. Elements such as building type, types of commerce, and amount of space allow us to distinguish different living communities. In general, “suburban homes typically are characterized by larger lots, fenced-in back yards, central air-conditioning and facades dominated by garage doors” (Oliver). These classifications allow categorization of different living environments to attribute different elements to each area. Suburbs and their “architectural form encourage the privatization of leisure time - instead of meeting on the front porch, new suburbanites spend evenings sequestered away in private yards or in air-conditioned television rooms” (Oliver). Living in the suburbs leads to a natural isolation. Conversely, cities foster social interaction with entertainment, restaurants, and social events on every block. Depending on the city one lives, restaurant options are endless. Similarly, finding museums to visit or parties to attend is a way less arduous task in the city than in the suburbs. The dispersal of commerce in an area impacts the overall atmosphere within a community.

Though suburbs are comprised of many different ethnicities and backgrounds, they tend to take on a single cultural identity. During times of segregation, white people tended to congregate in the suburbs, which is a large part of why suburbs are still associated with whites. Areas such as North Hollywood have become what demographer William Frey of the Milken Institute calls “‘melting pot suburbs,’ former bedroom communities, where newcomers have replaced older, predominantly white populations” (Kotkin). As more ethnic groups move to these neighborhoods for better financial security, they tend to adopt the stereotypical white suburban lifestyle. The children go to the local high school and then to the local college and return home to their house nearby, almost indistinguishable from the others. In order to fully understand suburban communities, one needs to establish the how they are visually classified.

Besides the ethnic aspect of suburbs, the physical features of the community play an important role in distinguishing the type of living area.

In comparison to other more populated areas such as West Hollywood, North Hollywood lacks retail density. In West Hollywood, streets such as Melrose and La Brea are inundated with designer boutiques, vintage shops, and unique cafes. This causes a natural influx of people who move to the area because of the options for entertainment.

In comparison to other more populated areas such as West Hollywood, North Hollywood lacks retail density. In West Hollywood, streets like Melrose and La Brea are inundated with designer boutiques, vintage shops, and unique cafes. This causes a natural influx of people who move to the area because of the options for entertainment. As evidenced by the distribution of shopping and restaurants, North Hollywood does not provide the same amount of entertainment for residents. West Hollywood features a variety of different foods such as Italian, Chinese, burgers, etc. (at least three restaurants per city block), whereas options in North Hollywood are more limited (around one restaurant per city block). This is similar to the shopping selection, which is neither extensive or specialized in North Hollywood. West Hollywood contains double the number of stores per city block as North Hollywood (two to one). Although stores such as Walmart and Target are present, and North Hollywood is by no means a food desert, compared to the extensive options in other nearby cities/districts, it can seem bare and lacking. Corporations such as Walmart and Target contribute positively to the child-oriented environment yet do not consider a different demographic: bored teens.

North Hollywood presents itself as a very family- friendly neighborhood. Many open spaces provide places for children to play and people to walk their dogs. While this is ideal for a family with young children, those who do not benefit from the open space and quiet neighborhood suffer. This environment fosters boredom for those who want entertainment or restaurant options. Without outlets for teens, crime becomes an easy way to express their emotions.

Due to the lack of entertainment and activities offered in North Hollywood, delinquency is an outlet for those who are young and bored. Suburbs are typically thought of as family- friendly but can transition into an unsafe environment if crime manifests. Many couples choose to raise children in the suburbs, so safety is of extreme importance in the community. As stated in *Crime in the Suburbs*, “the lack of legitimate outlets (such as recreational facilities) through which individuals can vent frustrations can facilitate unconventional behavior within the community” (Stahura). Outlets are of extreme importance not only for kids, but also adults in the community. When there is virtually nothing to do for entertainment, turning to crime could seem like an exciting/tempting option. In a study conducted by Vera Lopez, “thirty-one (52%) of the 60 delinquent acts involving property offenses were committed primarily for “kicks,” “fun,” or “thrills” (2008). It is likely that these crimes were perpetrated out of boredom and not malicious intent. That being said, crime negatively impacts the community and causes an uneasy feeling that leads to extreme vigilance for the rest of the residents. Although teenagers are especially vulnerable to the impacts of boredom, it also takes a toll on mental health among a wide range of members in the community.

In response to the social isolation associated with suburban areas, impacts on the residents (especially of young adult age) are damaging. One might think North Hollywood was a ghost town if they passed through on a Wednesday afternoon. Besides those in traffic, the occasional person walking their dog or waiting at the bus stop were the few signs of life we saw in this suburban community. The leaves rustling in the wind was the most prevalent sound with no conversations or construction work to interrupt it. According to *Business Insider*, the “vague sense of unnaturalness” one feels in a suburb can be explained. “Research from evolutionary psychology suggests there is a reason for this feeling, and it lies in humans’ natural preference for socialization and well-defined spaces – both traits suburbia often lacks” (Weller). The layout of homes does not support socializing with neighbors or anyone else that lives nearby. Residents can go in and out of their houses without crossing paths with others, whereas in an apartment building in the heart of the city, residents are naturally placed in more social situations (elevator rides, gyms, pools, and even the lobby all foster interaction in apartment buildings). Because humans thrive off of social interaction, not being exposed to other people on a daily basis can lead to depression and loneliness; another issue suburban in neighborhoods cause is drug-abuse risk in the youth: “A teenager will start out abusing alcohol, smoking marijuana or taking a stolen or borrowed prescription. The drug will provide the “high” that they are looking for” (Narconon). An addiction to any substance starts out small, but then the tolerance for those drugs build until the point that acquiring a harsher drug like heroin is a cheaper way to reach the level of “high” they’re after. Due to the lack of activities and social interaction, suburban teens are in search of something that will make them feel an emotion other than mundane boredom. Drugs are an exciting substance that will remove them from the monotony of everyday life. Suburban teens are not impoverished and therefore have access to doctors who can prescribe them drugs. Efforts to curtail this teenage malaise include education programs, family intervention, and community art projects. More specifically, Judy Baca conducted her mural project to create peace within the neighborhood and highlight the cultural background of California.

Judy Baca painted *The Great Wall of Los Angeles* to bring together different ethnicities through the process of painting the history of the surrounding area. *The Great Wall of Los Angeles* is situated in Tujunga wash, a dried-up river bed. Gated off to the public, the mural portrays a sense of distance between the viewer and the art itself. “Local and state history was examined for traces of Asian, Black, Chicano, and Native Americans during various eras of California’s history” (Baca). This mural was meant to represent not only the diversity in California, but also North Hollywood. Growing up in the area, Judy Baca witnessed distinct separation and even violence between different ethnic groups of students. As the Tujunga Wash was considered “relatively neutral gang territory,” she believed it would be a great place to display cultural/ethnic history. “Within a small geographical distance, Blacks, Chicanos, and Anglos led very separate lifestyles” (Baca). Now the mural doesn’t mean as much because it is not accessible, and society has become so homogenous that no one pays attention to it. Although it was meant to bring cultures together, those in North Hollywood have assimilated into their suburban environment so focus on cultural history/backgrounds is less emphasized. The process of painting the mural was of equal significance to the actual history within the mural.

Interpreting the images depicted on *The Great Wall of Los Angeles* is different for every individual who examines the paintings. The wide range of events, figures, and time periods of history allow citizens to consider where they come from and how their community developed. In hopes of promoting collaboration and learning among the diverse youth, Baca assigned a myriad of different subjects for each group to portray on the wall. During the process of painting the mural, “crews would be placed under the direction of an artist who would act as their leader and also as the focus of an ethnic culture” (Baca). Although Baca wanted the surrounding community to gain a better understanding of the local history, the main goal was to connect the youth of different backgrounds. By working together to conquer their painting tasks, barriers would fall making them forget about their differences. This mural does not offer the same accessibility as art pieces in surrounding Los Angeles communities.

In the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, murals line the streets plastered on sides of bare building walls. Unlike art in North Hollywood, however, the murals are easily accessible to the public.Subjects of the murals vary but include influential activists such as Nelson Mandela and Muhammad Ali. The accessibility of this art gives the community a sense of involvement, as if the art was made for the public to enjoy, not just the affluent few (like North Hollywood).

In similar fashion to *The Great Wall of Los Angeles*, North Hollywood has made attempts to beautify the area with art pieces that struggle to reach the broader community. Because the art in North Hollywood is widely inaccessible, it is more appealing to affluent residents. According to the NoHo Gallery in Los Angeles, they have “built up a fine arts reputation and client base which when combined with the strengths of NCG and nohoartsdistrict.com, is a powerful marketing tool for artists and collectors” (DeBevoise). Simply by mentioning collectors and curators, this art gallery immediately emphasizes a certain class of people. The gallery is focused on selling their art to those who can spend large amounts of money, and not on the possibility of art bringing a community together.

Suburban neighborhoods are typically comprised of many different ethnicities but lack cultural vibrancy due to conformity. Conformity and shortage of entertainment options often lead to erratic behaviors of teens such as crime and drug use. These outlets provide stimulation and activity that those who live in the community do not receive/ are searching for. Attempts to add things of value to the community have been made such as Judy Baca’s mural, *The Great Wall of Los Angeles*. However, interaction is limited exacerbating the pervading issues in suburbia. Although comfort and consistency are prevalent in suburban neighborhoods, this results in homogeneity initiating detrimental effects on the community such as boredom and isolation. With exposure to events like art exhibits at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, food festivals around the city, and sports events at the Staples Center, moving to the city of Los Angeles has broadened my horizons and exposed me to a whole new world of diversity and activities that my suburban hometown failed to offer.
