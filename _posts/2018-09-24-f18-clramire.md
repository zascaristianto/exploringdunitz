“Welcome to Hollywood where money literally grows on trees and litters the streets…” reads a caption of a random Instagram photo uploaded under the location of Downtown LA (Bennett). The uploader, a costume designer, captures a set for a tv show where fake money drifts around the streets of Downtown LA for a scene –and while the dollar bills will be picked up from the streets after filming, the influence of new money infiltrating Downtown LA will never be unseen (Bennett). Its new symbolic presence has prompted Downtown LA, a former unique neighborhood, towards becoming a more mainstream neighborhood in relation to its defining characteristics. Compared to historical demographics and public street art, the culture of Downtown Los Angeles’ people is being slowly eradicated through restoration. As the neighborhood evolves, the historical, diverse makeup of Downtown LA is being overtaken by higher income residents. Historical public art that once defined the neighborhood by promoting culture and unity also faces extinction. Through intervention of the neighborhood’s architecture, art, and prices, the City of LA is currently focusing on eradicating these key pillars that shaped Downtown LA in order to redefine it for monetary gain.  

Originally inhabited by minorities, Downtown LA historically served as the cultural epicenter of Los Angeles. When 44 Spanish settlers migrated to Los Angeles on September, 4, 1781, they founded El Pueblo de La Reina, an area that would later be known as the Historic Core of Downtown LA (Downtown LA History). With a land boom in the 1800s, this area was populated by an influx of people and characterized by increasing industry and transportation by railroads. The completion of the Southern Pacific, Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe, and Union Pacific Railroads by 1905 prompted the further construction of warehouses and industrial buildings, leading Downtown LA into the Industrial Age (The Los Angeles Conservancy). Because of available residential land and available jobs in industries such as the automobile and rubber industry, Downtown LA proved to be an attractive place for immigrants looking to establish themselves and their culture. Downtown’s many divisions such as Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Arts District, and Central City East are the result of these foreigners’ immigration and support Henri Lefebvre’s notion that “social relations are produced and sustained through space” (Jenks). Little Tokyo perfectly exemplifies how Downtown LA allowed community members to establish their roots and identities in such a heterogeneous society. Many of the art and the buildings in Little Tokyo tell the story of Japanese exclusion and serve as the foundation for Japanese American history. The Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple, built in to 1925, was a popular religious and social space for the Japanese living in LA pre-World War 2 (Little Tokyo Historic District). Much of its architecture mimics that of important temples in Kyoto, Japan and therefore serves as a strong tie for the Japanese to their home. Today, the building is occupied by the Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, something that Japanese Americans were denied of during World War II (Little Tokyo Historic District). Although only one of the many important buildings still standing in Little Tokyo, the Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple demonstrates how downtown LA has helped Japanese Americans maintain connection to their ethnic identity. The temple, now museum, is a physical testimony to the hardships Japanese Americans had to face and serves to bring the past and present together in order to shape the future. This physical space not only helps give Japanese Americans a sense of membership and a connection with their peers, but also helps others gain understanding of accurate Japanese American culture and the impact and importance of cultural diversity in Downtown LA. Other historic cultural sites such as La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Ángeles and the Garnier Building, otherwise known as the Chinese American Museum, similarly tell the story of other historical groups of people that, like the Japanese, inhabited Downtown LA. While Downtown may not be the most aesthetically pleasing location to all, it is an important neighborhood rich in history that helps community members maintain a sense of belonging to LA. As a result, Downtown LA is a hub that supports the many cultures that comprise Los Angeles.
 In addition to various ethnic groups, Downtown LA is marked by its large homeless population that takes advantage of its public space to form community. Upon entering San Julian Street near 6th street, it is hard for visitors to ignore the “Skid Row Super Mural” created by activist General Jeff and Skid Row residents (Winston Death Squad).

Figure 1: Homeless residents of Downtown LA emphasize Skid Row’s presence as a true community.
   {:.caption} 
     
The mural depicts a map with the strict boundaries of Skid Row as outlined in the Jones vs. the City of Los Angeles court case (Winston Death Squad). It also depicts Skid Row’s “official” sign with the city seal and a population reading “Too Many” (Winston Death Squad).  The mural not only takes a stab at LA’s inability to move the homeless move out of poverty, but also serves to physically define and unite its people. It demonstrates how the homeless of downtown LA have claimed their territory, developed a community around it, and are here to stay for the long term. 

The creation of Skid Row is a result of the Industrial Age when cheap, small hotels and transitional living spaces popped up to accommodate the influx of workers but were later deemed unsafe. When many of these buildings were torn down, lower income residents were displaced and began residing in the streets. Today, “of the estimated 91,00 homeless people living in Los Angeles County, it is estimated that 2,521 homeless persons can be found within the .4 square miles of the Skid Row area. Those numbers equate to roughly 3% of the county’s entire homeless population residing within an area that comprises only .0001% of the county’s total land area” (Community Redevelopment Agency). As a result, the high density of homeless people in downtown LA has contributed to the formation of an inclusive community for these lower income LA residents. Common neighborhood activities include gathering at Glady’s Park, playing basketball and board games, and convening on the streets to converse, share art, and even share literature (Bacon). By engaging with each other, community members have established Skid Row as a neighborhood and take on a family like culture. Resident Linda Harris further explains, “People here accept you for who you are...Down here everyone is equal” (Bacon). Downtown LA therefore cultivates a sense of belonging to those who have been pushed out of LA and serves as an important shared space for lower income residents. 
 As an explanation for contemporary development, current demographics of Downtown LA differ wildly from the original makeup of diverse backgrounds and minority groups. Downtown LA formed as a melting pot of different races and culture; however, recent census data tells of a different story. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a 36% increase in the Caucasian makeup of Downtown LA while African American population fell by 17%. This reveals how as more white residents came into the neighborhood, the cultures that made up the original property were becoming less prominent. Former residents are unable to keep up with the rising neighborhood standards caused by this increase in Caucasian population and are being pushed out further from the city to less developed areas. As more white residents move into downtown, the cultural makeup, ranging from food to business to art, is being impacted. Even by simply touring downtown, one is able to notice the constant construction that takes place, renewing the old with less culturally accurate representations. The current demographics therefore reveal the new complexities being brought onto DTLA and serve as a physical contrast to how Downtown LA historically visually appeared. 

In the past, communal space was dominated by public art that honored others, establishing values for the community. Artists utilized the free and unregulated space of Downtown LA to guarantee that influential minorities and their actions would be remembered in the future. On the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Figueroa Street stands a three panel art tribute to Gilbert W. Lindsay, the first African American council member of Los Angeles (Ward Williams). In 1995, Pat Wards William enacted the memorial and utilized small tiles with hand colored images as the small pieces for the larger picture (Williams).

   {:.image}
Figure 2: Pat Ward Williams ensures Gilbert Lindsay’s legacy through a tribute ceramic tile mural.
   {:.caption} 

These small images include moments of Lindsay throughout his life and career and pictures with peers such as Martin Luther King (Williams).  An icon in the African American community, Lindsay worked his way from working in cotton fields to working as a janitor in city hall to being promoted and appointed by other white council members until he became a council member himself. Like other memorials in Downtown, the Gilbert W. Lindsay tribute paints its subject as a true American hero who is not to be forgotten. By displaying some of his most important moments, William has chosen how Lindsay will be remembered. Williams hopes that “people who may not have known him now may feel like they do” (Williams). By offering insight into history, the mural serves to connect residents to these moments and embed these moments in the culture of the neighborhood. The mural is a physical representation of a community that values education, equal opportunities, and diversity. Those who walk by the mural, even younger generations, can utilize the images as tools to understand what kinds of actions in their society should be honored. Memorials promote community identity by identifying what the community should work towards. They are a pillar for what the community stands for long-term. In addition to other purposes, public art in communal spaces therefore establish the overall principles the citizens wish to live by. 

Communal space was also dominated by public art that brought attention to problems, helping minorities to have a voice in the political climate. Through freedom of expression, artists helped those who do not have a formal or recognized position accomplish a goal. Mario Toreros’ 1978 mural titled We Are Not a Minority utilizes the image of revolutionary Che Guevara and the phrase “we are not a minority” (Fuentes).

![We Are Not a Minority Mural](images/ We Are Not A Minority-thumb-600x401-55081.jpg)
   {:.image}
Figure 3: Artist Mario Torero utilizes revolutionary Che Guevara to unite and uplift community members who have been discriminated.
   {:.caption}

Located on the back of a low income housing building, the mural acts as activism and unites the Spanish people of Downtown to combat the issue of equal rights in several ways. Bolding the word “not,” Torero emphasizes his message, that minority groups are not to be disregarded, very clearly so neighborhood residents can easily interpret it. He paints the “A” in the phrase to mimic a temple and appeal to the religious Hispanic residents. The final word of the phrase, “minority,” is heavily shaded and painted in a larger print to emphasize the weight of the word and the issue on equal rights for minorities. He tops the painting off by depicting Che Guevera, a symbol for rebellion and revolution, in the same position as the classic Uncle Sam poster: the mural therefore seems to try and guide Hispanic minorities towards action (Fuentes). In this case, the artist utilizes a mural to support a cause he resonates with that could be seen as controversial. He urges Hispanics living in downtown to unite and fight for what he believes is right and right for them. The mural’s presence in the environment gives a voice to its residents and in theory protects their voice from the majority trying to silence it. While the mural is targeted towards those being marginalized, it also serves to catch public attention by saying what others are not. This kind of public political art does not shy away from the issue and forces those who view it to form some sort of connection with its topic. Therefore, one of the impacts of public art is that it serves to bring awareness to issues involving those who are trivialized.

Lastly, public art helped to engage community members, fostering collaboration in paving way for the future. Involving members of all generations, artists help the past meet the present and promote sustainability for a neighborhood. For example, in 1995, the Chinatown and Lincoln Heights Task Force joined children, parents, senior citizens, and business owners of the neighborhood to paint a mural that recognizes Chinese experience of immigration to America (Lee). Prior to the creation of the mural, the youth involved in the project were required to interview different residents of the neighborhood, so the final painting could embody diverse views. The completed mural displays the phrase “Together, we can build a better community” in Chinese characters (Lee). The mural brings the attention of policy makers to immigrant families struggling in the neighborhood. It’s effectiveness, however, lies in the incorporation of Chinatown’s youth, demonstrating that Chinatown is here to stay for years to come. By engaging all different types of residents especially in regards to age difference, this community art project promotes the sustainability of Chinatown’s future through building collective identity. It helps empower the younger generation to lead while also building off of the long-standing values and principles held by older residents. This is suggestive through the use of the encompassing word “together.” The act of completing a goal with others helps them build closer interpersonal ties and commitment to their neighborhood’s shared vision. If the mural remains standing throughout future years, it can serve to further unite and inspire others who view it and who enter the neighborhood. Therefore, the impact of public art, now being destroyed, can lastly be seen in sustaining a neighborhood’s future through the interaction of its different members. 

By altering Downtown’s landscape through hostile architecture, the City of Los Angeles has eradicated Downtown’s sense of community. Compared to its more inviting beginnings, the neighborhood is now plagued by bench dividers, tall fences, and spaces that lack seating and shade, all of which deter community members from convening and utilizing public space. Pershing Square, a public park in Downtown LA, is evident of these changes. 

![Pershing Square](images/ Screen Shot 2018-11-26 at 6.49.39 PM.png)
   {:.image}
Figure 4: Pershing Square exemplifies the transforming hostile architecture that is eradicating communal space in Downtown LA.
   {:.caption} 

In the 1800s, the park accommodated residents by providing seating from lush grass and benches and shade from trees (Loomis). The park’s design, which featured a central meeting point, encouraged community members to take advantage of the space (Loomis). The park today, on the other hand, is mostly made of concrete and lacks trash cans, proper seating, and shade from trees (Loomis). What used to be a safe haven for the homeless now serves as an obstacle to their daily life. The results of the city’s urban planning demonstrate a take on aggressive architecture and exemplify the city’s view on former Downtown residents: that they are outsiders and threats to new development. Layout is now complicated and serves no use to the community and its specific needs. Public space in Downtown formally allowed residents to embrace the outdoors as a space to develop community ties and create experiences and values. It traditionally was designed to be inviting, especially to homeless community members, and have a more open floor plan to allow variety in usage. While the physicality of Downtown LA remains, its usefulness is close to gone. It’s now a void in the landscape of Los Angeles that discourages community members from interacting with each other and therefore stops members from forming an individual tie to their community. As the city continues to utilize hostile architecture, community members are losing connection with their neighborhood and fellow neighbors. 	

By also censoring freedom of expression through mural banning and replacing, the City of Los Angeles has demolished Downtown’s uniqueness and character. When visitors walk around a now tourist friendly Downtown LA, it is not uncommon for them to spot giant murals of Kobe Bryant, the Los Angeles Orchestra, and advertisements for
Beats Headphones.

						CAPTION: Figure 5: Sports murals demonstrate the commercialization of art for city profit (Never). 

Downtown LA’s murals reflect the strong influence of commercialization and demonstrate that Downtown LA has quite literally been whitewashed as a result. In the late 1990’s, the City of Los Angeles proposed a ban on murals by categorizing them as signs and strictly regulating them accordingly. The city took away Downtown residents’ rights in order to clean up the neighborhood and decrease public advertising, a source of income for the city. While the ban was challenged by an ordinance that passed in 2013, artists are still finding it hard to express themselves legally: Original mural art, “defined as a one of a kind, hand painted, hand tiled, or digitally printed images on the exterior wall of a building that does not contain any commercial message,” is now subject to a building permit from the Department of Building and Safety (Los Angeles Department of City Planning). This permit application requires artists to pay a minimum $60 fee, contact his or her neighborhood council, record a covenant with the Office of the County Recorder, and adhere to all mural content rules (Los Angeles Department of City Planning). By making the process more lengthy and complicated, the city is utilizing financial and creatively restrictive boundaries to stop artists from making murals that don’t align with the “new” Downtown LA. Carmen Zella, founder of the Do Art Foundation, a non-profit that aids artists in bringing their projects to life, reflects on the permit process: “I’d be really surprised if any individual artists have gone through the process. It takes a lot of oversight and management to pull all the pieces of the puzzle together the way it’s structured presently. It’s not artist friendly” (Vankin). While other organizations similar to the Do Art Foundation such as Art Share LA and the LA Freewalls Project have popped up in order to help struggling artists, their resources can only cover so much. 

The City of Los Angeles ultimately has the last say and as a result Downtown LA is now being taken over by more Instagram friendly murals that support the city’s vision. Jen Stark’s bright mural, Chromatic Cascade, is a popular result when searching for Downtown LA art (Stark).

					STARK PIC
					CAPTION: Figure 6:  New murals, such as Jen Stark’s mural Chromatic Cascade, attempt to clean up Downtown LA and attract visitors.

Its bright colors and visual attractiveness charms visitors and cleans up the community. While the mural makes for a fun picture, it does nothing to re-enforce the culture of Downtown LA. Instead, it serves to liken Downtown LA’s image and feel to that of nicer areas in LA and therefore de-recognizes its diverse community members. In order to restore it, the City of Los Angeles is trying to minimize the traditional role art plays in impacting the Downtown community and its people. Through various challenges posed to artists, the city is selectively moderating freedom of expression and intentionally changing the culture of Downtown.

As the standard of living in Downtown increases, policy makers and businesses are pushing Downtown LA towards gentrification and displacing original residents. According to RENTCafe’s recent study, Downtown LA, specifically areas with the zip code 90014, is the most gentrified neighborhood in the United States (Szekely). Between 2000 and 2016, Downtown LA’s home value has changed 707% as a result of household income changing 95% and higher education changing 857% (Szekely). As wealthier businesses develop the Downtown area, the price of land and the standard of living has skyrocketed, attracting more affluent residents. Modern apartment complexes such as Canvas LA and Pegasus Apartments, offering units starting from $2000-4000, target these changing Downtown LA demographics (20 Best Apartments in Downtown Los Angeles). For a neighborhood with a former medium household income of $15,000 in the year 2000, intense housing development and increasing rents is not sustainable for the community (Downtown). Residents are now being priced out of their neighborhood and can no longer rely on disappearing affordable housing. At a recent development meeting for the city, it was revealed that over 8,000 people applied for the 55 units set aside for low income housing in the Downtown LA apartment complex, the Emerson (Kim). Realizing that the restoration of Downtown LA was an opportunity for economic gain, the City of Los Angeles has been the biggest supporter in Downtown LA’s transition. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning is gearing up to launch DTLA2040, an extension of their revitalization plan that emphasizes rezoning (DTLA2040). Residents, especially those living on Skid Row, oppose the plan because it allows luxury housing to take over areas dominated by homeless community members and low income residents. This displacement not only affects the people of Downtown LA but also the longstanding businesses that have helped shape the neighborhood’s character. All of the history and hard work embedded in the original infrastructure founded by immigrants is at risk of being lost. Therefore, as outside forces continue to intervene in the future planning of Downtown LA’s layout, the neighborhood draws closer to total gentrification.

The role demographics and public art play in enforcing community identity is changing radically. Through the intervention of Downtown LA’s architecture, art, and pricing, the City of Downtown LA is creating a new community culture that displaces old residents and their history. As they plan to accommodate an influx of new residents, the city is prioritizing profit over people and redefining what it means to be an outsider in the neighborhood. The city fails to realize that restoration of poorer communities is a social issue that puts businesses and people in jeopardy. It is a clear demonstration of an abuse of power and calls into question what a true community values. It is time to start thinking: is a true neighborhood sustained by the prioritization of money or by the members that cultivate its sense of community?
