Picture a bright, sunny day in beautiful L.A., walking down the streets of Rodeo Drive, doing what tourists do when they come to the city of Angels. Beverly Hills has grown to become one of the most iconic neighborhoods in Los Angeles, with a culture that many admire and aspire to be a part of; when compared to the grungy streets of Downtown LA, it is easy to understand why. Some people correlate Downtown LA street art with low education and low-income; however, there are meanings hidden in these works of art that allow for a sense of protection and a voice for cultures to share their identities. These art contributions are valuable statements that give downtown L.A. a distinctive edge that no other city in Los Angeles can rival. The threat of eliminating these paintings Illustrates the inherent danger of the eradication of various cultures that have long called L.A. as their home. As our society drifts in the direction of identifying “beauty” with the clean white walls of Beverly Hills, one question comeCleaners to mind: what does it mean to be ‘cleaner’? The murals that scatter around Downtown aren't connected to the deficiency in education and the poverty; they serve as the bare faces of the numerous identities that keep refuge there- and by painting over these masterpieces the diversity and uniqueness of Downtown LA are at risk.
	When walking through the various neighborhoods of Downtown LA, it is evident that each district’s art captures a transcendent theme. A mural is a large picture that is painted or affixed directly on a wall or ceiling, and according to Judy Vannais, a senior content developer and writer in Brooklyn, New York, the community identification helps find expression in community-related art. Judy claims that “In terms of the physical environment murals have provided visual relief and function as focal points for cultural identity” and that “While not primarily their purpose, murals can be seen to be, in part, a response to an urban environment which was undifferentiated at best, and alienating at worst” (Judy Vannais, 22). The insurmountable amounts of murals scattered around the streets of Downtown demonstrate the cultural identities that have taken shelter in each of the neighborhoods, and just by looking at the art depicted one can get a glimpse of their experiences. The cultures may use these murals in order to be distinctive within an environment where all are the same, in order to share their stories when feeling lonesome within the communities and to shed this part of the community would be to discard these identities that have found shelter in these paintings.
	An illustration of exactly how many cultures reside in the Downtown region of Los Angeles can be seen using the census data. Being the largest city on the West coast, it is not surprising to hear that there’s a diverse culture within the city of LA. Downtown LA is highly diverse for the city of Los Angeles, in addition to being highly diverse for the country (LA Times). Just by looking at the statistics that consist of a 22.3% Black, 21.3% Asian, 36.7 % Latino, and 16.2 % White population, it is easy to see exactly how diverse the city is and how each demographic around the world has a cultural demonstration. Despite being one of the most diverse parts of the Los Angeles City, downtown is also one of the most up and coming and renovative areas. Downtown attempts to replicate the beautiful tourist spots like Beverly Hills, which leads to massive construction projects. Furthermore, this abundant amount of construction is threatening the existence of these murals and the identities that have sought refuge in them, as cultured buildings become torn down in exchange for beautiful skyscrapers that have no meaning. In order to face this problem, a group called the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles has evolved, a nonprofit group whose mission is to preserve the murals painted on public and private property throughout the Los Angeles region.

Although there is protection established by the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles for the construction against the murals that the many neighborhoods have, the cultures still face setbacks in growing within their districts. Among the communities that have formed in downtown throughout the years, Little Tokyo is one of the most recognized and acknowledged for being an authentic representation of what the Japanese culture is. As a location that many tourists target, it is known to be “one section of Los Angeles to which there retains economic, symbolic, and institutional connections based on ethnic identity” (Hillary Jenks). However, at the same time, even this prominent destination is facing challenges against its survival as the area is in a “much diminished current form” resulting from the construction and tearing down of the social architecture that has once stood to express the identities. Among the parts of little Tokyo that have been torn down in the process are murals that the people of the neighborhood engraved, murals that revealed the identities that found Downtown Los Angeles as its home. “Home is Little Tokyo” is a sixteen by forty-feet mural that built a sense of community among the Japanese Americans. Artist and creator Osumi stated that “Our goal was not just to make a mural, but to build a sense of community” (Osumi). Osumi's goal provides evidence that the murals engraved across Little Tokyo- across the many, diverse neighborhoods of Downtown LA- are essential aspects of the cultural identities, and by tearing these down in efforts to ‘clean up the region', they are in turn discriminating against the delicacies of many people’s lives.
	Besides the positive outcomes of the beauty of murals such as an increase in tourism, there are other reasons that the murals are standing in the streets of LA. While the murals are visually appealing depictions that result in many tourists and other positive outcomes for a neighborhood, it is also a means to reveal the politics and ideologies specific to that district. On the topic of murals in Los Angeles, some say that “Murals were part of a growing trend in US cities to rely on public art to spur economic revitalization and foster profitable place distinction” (Miles and Adams). This is an illustration of how the people residing in the different districts of Downtown LA used the growing trend of murals in order to show who they are and prove that they belong. Barbara Carrasco is a real-life example of a Latino woman using her mural as a way to reflect her distinct addition to the city, as she created a piece in 1981 for Los Angeles’ bicentennial. As a drafting artist for Los Angeles’ Community Redevelopment Agency, she wanted to “show a diverse reflection of Los Angeles” and to “show what I (she) wish was in the history books” (Deborah Vankin). The mural succeeded in forming the perspective of the Los Angeles communities of color, and how each culture is woven together to create a piece, Downtown L.A., that matters.

	Within the murals are the hidden meanings that each piece of art depicts, and these added together are what gives the streets of downtown meaning and character unlike no other. These murals have grown to become “recognized as symbols of Downtown Los Angeles in art circles locally and worldwide” (Jose Cardenas). Regardless, a mural called “The Pope of Broadway” is an example of a dancing tribute to Eastside actor Anthony Quinn, standing at 70 feet in the streets of Downtown L.A., reminding everyone that walks by of the Latino influences that has impact on the city. Moreover, as murals similar to “The Pope of Broadway” have begun to become replaced by the towering skyscrapers that Downtown Los Angeles has become gradually more populated with, the character that these murals have been giving the neighborhoods are leaving, making the city blander than ever. If one were to walk down the neighborhoods of Beverly Hills, the only background that would be expected by a person to have is the wealth and sense of white culture, which is something the all-white landscape gives off as a vibe.
	Among the neighborhoods in Downtown L.A., Skid Row has experienced the worst poverty. To face this, the Poor Peoples Campaign was informed intersectional to gather every race, age, and gender to end the poverty and policies that led to the experience. An example of this is the “colorful mural along the wall of Catch 21, a trendy Skid Row low-cost fresh fish restaurant. Painted in 2017 by Dimitri, a Los Angeles Catholic Worker muralist who travels the country, the mural unfolds the beauty of indigenous community fishing. Embedded in the mural are the words: WATER IS LIFE – DEFEND THE SACRED – JUSTICE” (Tom Grode). Located among a section called the seafood district within the 50 blocks of Skid Row, the murals such as food and water. The murals themselves are not forms of graffiti that should be taken down to clean up the city; they are not evidential pieces of the low income and poverty. Instead, they are the voices of those that have intentions of fixing these problems affecting the districts and are an essential piece to the Los Angeles culture.
	Murals highlight problems that reside within the neighborhoods or that help promote the cultural identities within the diverse population of Downtown L.A. In comparison, the street art graffiti- spray painted on at night- may be one of the aspects of L.A. that should be cleaned up in order to help form a cleaner neighborhood. For instance, on one of the backsides, West 23rd Street is a back-to-back mural of a Latino male and female as well as the words VICTOR across the landscape. VICTOR CLOTHING is written across the painting as well, which points the viewer to the artists' purpose to highlight those Latino men and women’s clothing and possibly point them towards the purchase of something similar or to show the cultural importance that these outfits have on the neighborhood. On the other hand, near the bottom of the murals, there is a significant amount of graffiti, filling the areas that are reachable by spray-paint with signatures of those that came to vandalize. In comparison to the meaningful artwork of the mural, this graffiti near the bottom is something that a group came to spray paint in the dead of night to leave their mark on the city. This is something that is not a needed part of the culture of L.A. It may not be too far of a reach to say that this is correlational with the poverty and violence problems that take part in the district, as the people that are spray painting over this meaningful message merely to put their names or words down on a wall are not thinking of the effects of their actions.

   All in all, the graffiti that besieges the neighborhoods of Downtown LA are not as confident of an addition to the city, and the murals mark a completely different identity among the world of art as they hold meaning that helps those that see it gain knowledge, as well as the artist behind it, find refuge. A ‘Mural Mayor’ has surged in the area of downtown recently as well by the name of Daniel Lahoda, as he has drawn praise and controversy over the many murals he has drawn and helped gain knowledge with. According to Estela Lopez, the executive director of Central City East, “He has turned the neighborhood into a museum without walls... Murals have always been here, but not of this scope. Daniel created an infrastructure to put the Arts District on the map” (Estela Lopez). This affirmation that multiple numbers of murals composed by this ‘Mural Mayor’ have grown to become a “museum without walls” comes to prove the point that these beautiful paintings on the walls of LA are a vital part of the identities that locate in the area of downtown, and without them the neighborhood would cease to be the same.
	Altogether, the Downtown Los Angeles community has grown to become sustained by the artwork that provides the diverse cultures that have taken refuge in the districts, making downtown one of the most sensitive locations on the west coast and more specifically within Los Angeles. Regardless of the need for a cleaner and less impoverished neighborhood, the evidence that points to the murals being an essential addition to the peoples that reside in the district’s lives shows how critical the messages that sent through these messages are. In comparison to the elegant and clean landscape of Beverly Hills, the murals that fill downtown give it a charismatic feel, a different edge that changes in parallel to the identities and cultures that take up the neighborhoods space. So, the next time you are taking a walk down a beautiful street of LA on a bright and sunny day, take a look at your surroundings, think about the diversity of where you are and see how the neighborhood, you are in reflects the population that lives there.
