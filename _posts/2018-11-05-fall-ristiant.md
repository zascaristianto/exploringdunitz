The relationship between my all-girls high school, Hockaday, and its all-boys counterpart, St. Mark’s, was the most problematic part of my high school experience. Especially recently, the toxicity of the Hockaday-St. Mark’s relationship has been underscored in our brother school’s constant disregard for rape culture and the gravity of sexual assault. This mindset conflicts with Hockaday’s mission, girl empowerment, indicating that the relationship is obsolete; however, Hockaday values its pristine image too highly to cut ties. This emphasis on perception, despite reality, plagues Los Angeles as well. Located in University Park, an area plagued by gentrification, Mercado La Paloma self-markets as a refuge from said gentrification; however, the marketplace exemplifies it. Gentrification in the neighborhood continues to rise: housing prices skyrocket, causing low-income residents to be displaced. Moreover, Mercado La Paloma promotes itself as a sanctuary from gentrification, illustrated by its mission statement, mural, choice of vendors and restaurants, and interior décor. Lastly, diverging from its image, the marketplace’s restaurants target the primarily white middle class, the crowd it ultimately attracts, and excludes cheaper vendors—typifying gentrification. 
	The price of housing in the University Park neighborhood continues to increase. Objectively, prices are skyrocketing. According to an interview with one of the vendors in Mercado La Paloma, a lifelong inhabitant of University Park, prices have changed immensely. Sixteen years ago, a two-bedroom apartment costed $600; now, the same two-bedroom apartment costs more than twice as much, $1300. Such a drastic change in price can be attributed partly to the competition between the locals, who have historically lived in the area, and people connected to USC. According to Joe Donlin, the director of Equitable Development at Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE), the limited capacity of on campus housing has forced students to live off campus, and faculty and staff often want to live closer to work (Velez, 2015). Because these students, faculty, and staff are actively seeking housing outside USC, they must compete for said housing with current residents of University Park, thus increasing demand and housing prices. This issue, Donlin says, has been exacerbated by the university’s shift from a commuter to a residential campus (Velez, 2015). House flipping in University Park, “one of the best neighborhoods left” in Los Angeles, has also caused living prices to increase (Khouri, 2016). Flippers, who buy houses for cheap prices, renovate them, and sell them at a higher price, are especially active in the area. The process of flipping, in theory, raises the prices of the homes. In practice, flippers price strategically: high enough to make a profit, and low enough to outcompete more expensive neighborhoods, like Culver City (Khouri, 2016).   
	University Park residents, especially in the context of Los Angeles, tend to be of lower socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status is conceptualized as “a combination of economic, social, and work status,” which can be measured by income and education, and upon inspection of the University Park neighborhood, it is clear that the area is lacking in both areas (Psaki et. al, 2014). As far as income goes, the median household income in the area is $18,533 (“Mapping LA”, 2000). This is an income well into the lower class, and it is both low for the city of Los Angeles and low for the county, for context (“Mapping LA”, 2000). Furthermore, the percentage of households that earn $20,000 or less is high for the county, making up roughly 60% of the population (“Mapping LA”, 2000). The University Park area not only lacks income, but it also lacks in education. The majority of residents in the community, about 52%, have less than a high school education (“Mapping LA”, 2000). Apparently, the percentage of residents 25 and older with less than a high school diploma is high for the county (“Mapping LA”, 2000). This dearth of income and education combined means that the local population in University Park cannot cope with the rising housing prices in the area because they simply do not have the resources to do so. 
	Because the local University Park residents cannot keep up with soaring prices, they get displaced. This displacement is comprehensive, apparent in both the residential and commercial sense. Anecdotes from “Youth Voices: Gentrification,” a panel of college-age locals talking about their experiences with gentrification, depict the residential aspect of displacement. Mary Reyes, a CSU Northridge student from the University Park area, remarked that building owners often look for ways to push out existing tenants so that the apartments could be rented to higher paying customers (Sequiera, 2017). One such way: landlords have issued three-day eviction notices to lower class tenants—tenants like Reyes’ close relatives, who would have left their apartments immediately had they not gotten assistance from lawyers (Sequiera, 2017). Moreover, advertising and marketing also drive out University Park locals. People who own housing around USC have learned to give preference to students because, generally, they will pay more money than those who have historically lived in the area (Velez, 2015). Joe Donlin reflects on the advertising and marketing used for housing in University Park: “You can see banners or signage in the neighborhoods around the University that either suggest or directly say that housing is for USC students” (Velez, 2015). This effectively excludes local residents from purchasing housing, forcing them to look elsewhere for places to live. This displacement is not limited to the residential sector—it also affects the commercial sector. Similar to the eviction notices given to less fortunate University Park citizens, smaller businesses can receive eviction notices as well. Zoe Guillory, owner of a vintage boutique in the neighborhood, and other businesses in the same building, received a 30-day eviction notice to make way for middle-class suited commercial ventures (Khouri, 2016). Subsequently, a restaurant will replace her boutique, epitomizing the pushing out of lower income populations in favor of the more affluent.   
	The mission statement of Mercado La Paloma frames the marketplace as a socially-conscious, culturally-diverse necessity. This representation contrasts with the gentrification rampant throughout the University Park neighborhood, which, as opposed to uniting its citizens, stratifies and separates them. The second sentence of the mission statement emphasizes the historic need of the area: “This area has historically suffered from lack of investment – including a lack of quality jobs and business opportunities, quality gathering spaces, healthy food choices, art and cultural opportunities.” The repetition of words highlighting need, such as “suffered” and “lack,” illustrates that University Park needs Mercado La Paloma. The market, in the eyes of the founders, provides a multifaceted quality that the area needed. Not only does the market provide a service to an inherently needy community, but Mercado La Paloma also does so in a socially-conscious and culturally-diverse way: “In 1996 in response to the desire of area residents for a local version of the bustling markets in their home countries and the need for local economic development opportunities, the idea of Mercado La Paloma was born.” Again, the wording is deliberate, emphasizing necessity through words such as “desire” and “need,” and the phrase “desire of area residents” frames the venture as one stemming solely from the people, rather than for money-related reasons. The plural form of the word country in the phrase “bustling markets in their home countries,” furthermore, establishes Mercado La Paloma as a diverse place where a multitude of cultures converge. 
	The mural located on the back of Mercado La Paloma likens the market to a Hellenistic, bustling bazaar—an open forum for cultural exchange. This imagery reinforces the rhetoric of the mission statement in that it depicts the marketplace as wholly separate from the community, a haven of sorts. Most apparent while examining the mural from afar, Greco-Roman columns line the sides of the metaphorical market (Figure 1). Likely, the artists selected these columns to reference historical Greece and the cultural exchange that occurred there. Trade of goods, ideas, and culture was an integral component of ancient Greece, and the columns insinuate that Mercado La Paloma prioritizes similar values. One of the Mercado’s most important values, moreover, is diversity, a concept manifested in the mural through a variety of races and art forms. Though most of the people in the mural are Hispanic, likely because they comprise the largest ethnic majority in University Park, all races are represented in some capacity: Asians, blacks, whites, and even Native Americans (“Neighborhood Data,” 2018). Furthermore, cultural diversity is expressed through art. A man in a cowboy hat plays a violin, while another plays a xylophone; a woman paints a mural of Virgin Mary (Figure 2), while another waves a papel picado, a traditional cut-paper craft from Mexico. Taken altogether, the different types of races and art forms symbolize the diversity the marketplace covets greatly. In addition to art and race, another significant manifestation of cultural exchange in the mural is the intersection between modern and traditional. Some images decidedly represent the traditional—the traditional Native American weaving, the columns, the elderly—while others are more contemporary—the Los Angeles Angels baseball hat, the Tweety-themed birthday cake, the Rugrats t-shirt (Figure 3). Ultimately, all of this variance, whether it be varying art forms, ethnicities, or time periods, is included to demonstrate that Mercado La Paloma is a place for all differences to coexist. 
	The choice of vendors and restaurants in the market is methodical, meant to convey a sense of convergence and diversity. Mercado La Paloma features five vendors—Artesanias Oaxacenas, Gloria’s Alterations, Joe’s Sports World, Sihsahil, and Quest Insurance—and seven restaurants—Azla, Burger Plaza Grill, Chichen Itza Restaurant, Oaxacalifornia Café Juice Bar, Taqueria Vista Hermosa, Thai Corner Food Express, and Holbox Seafood. Analysis of these vendors and restaurants reveal that a calculated effort was made to include food and goods from a myriad of different regions. The restaurants include food from five continents, ranging from Ethiopian, to American, to Thai. The vendors, while not quite as diverse, still manage to cover local and international goods. While Joe’s Sports World sells paraphernalia from local Los Angeles sports teams, like the Dodgers, Kings, and Lakers, Artesanias Oaxacenas and Sihasil both sell products from Mexico, as well as Central and South America. Choosing vendors and restaurants that represent a host of geographical regions means that the market will have something for everyone. In addition to regional variety, the selection of restaurants, more specifically, considers differing levels of health and nutrition. For the more health-conscious crowd, the Mercado includes options like Oaxacalifornia Juice Bar, which offers detox juices, and Azla, which serves only vegan food. On the other end of the spectrum, Burger Plaza Grill has an item on their menu called the “Double King Chili Cheese Burger,” a burger that contains a whopping 1070 calories. This spectrum of nutrition means that the Mercado is truly a place where anyone and everyone—vegans, junk-food addicts, or anywhere in between—can dine.
	The décor of Mercado La Paloma reinforces its portrayal as a multicultural neutral zone. Though the decoration may seem haphazard and heterogenous at first, certain themes connect all of the design choices, which were very deliberate. The dove is an example of such a deliberate image repeated throughout the interior and the exterior of the Mercado. This image echoes the name of the market itself, as paloma means dove in Spanish, and can be found carved into the sidewalk (Figure 4), painted on the tables, and featured on the market’s logo. Because the dove connotes peace, the symbol was most likely repeated throughout the venue to communicate the idea that the market is a safe place, away from the gentrification war that plagues University Park. The market, in addition to being covered with doves, is bursting to the seams with color. The tables boast decorative, painted tiles (Figure 5), the walls are painted in bright colors such as red, yellow, and orange, and strings of multicolored papel picado decorate the front of Oaxacalifornia. Upon analysis, it seems probable that this spectrum of colors was chosen to parallel the spectrum of cultures, food, vendors, and people represented in Mercado La Paloma. Finally, one of the most prominent art pieces in the venue was the display by Piece by Piece, a social enterprise that does mosaic work with people transitioning out of homelessness. The display consists of an amalgamation of small mosaic art pieces, quotes from participants and volunteers, and pictures of participants making mosaics (Figure 6). Not only does the mix of art pieces, photos, and quotes emphasize the socially conscious efforts of the Mercado, but it also reinforces the concept of diversity the venue tries so hard to emphasize—just like the medley of glass pieces that make up a mosaic.
	Regardless of the way that Mercado La Paloma presents itself, the market, in reality, is not designed for a diverse socioeconomic crowd, but rather the middle or upper-middle class. The middle class as a target audience for commercialization, especially in a lower-income neighborhood, is one of the hallmarks of gentrification. Examination of the price points of each of the restaurants reveals that Mercado La Paloma was not intended for the local population. The plates from Al Pastor cost from $9.99 to $13.99, the main dishes from Chichen Itza cost from $10.99 to $18.99, and Oaxacalifornia Juice Bar has juices that can cost up to $8. These prices do not correlate with the area’s food insecurity, defined by Feeding America as “a lack of available financial resources for food at the level of the household,” as 88.56% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch (“Understand Food Security”, 2018; “Neighborhood Data”, 2018). This mismatch, then, means that it would not be logical for citizens of this community to spend such large amounts of money on food. In addition to the high price points of the food, analysis of trash from the surrounding area reveals that the food inside the Mercado is not typically consumed by the University Park population. Several notable food-related trash items littered the parking lot: a McCafe coffee cup, a stack of three takeout boxes, the wrapper from a frozen breakfast sandwich, and a wrapper from a Bubu Lubu, a Mexican chocolate bar. Evaluating this trash altogether, it becomes apparent that the University Park population, for the most part, prioritizes convenience over health; the fast food, takeout, frozen food, and candy bar are all not necessarily nutritious, but they are all accessible and portable. A sit-down meal at the Mercado, then, would seem extremely inefficient and thus unappealing in comparison. Therefore, the marketplace could not have been meant for the local population.
	An examination of the people eating lunch at Mercado La Paloma reveals that the people that frequent the marketplace are disproportionately white. Rather than a comprehensive haven from gentrification, as promised, the Mercado is a hub for gentrification: a place where outsiders frequent. Upon first glance, the crowd that eat lunch at the Mercado seem relatively racially diverse; though the majority are white, there is a good sprinkling of Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. This diversity, interestingly, actually symbolizes gentrification because it demonstrates how citizens of University Park have been displaced by people from other communities. According to USC Price’s Neighborhood Data for Social Change, Hispanics are the most prevalent ethnic group, comprising 32.62% of the population, followed by whites at 29.19%, followed by Asians at 28.29%, followed by blacks at 6.32% (“Neighborhood Data”, 2018). Given these statistics, it is evident that the Mercado does not truly serve as a haven from gentrification; if it was, the population going to the marketplace would be mostly Hispanic, indicating that the other ethnic groups must have come from outside the community. Gentrification in Los Angeles, in addition, has been correlated with the influx of white people because, as USC sociology professor Manuel Pastor aptly put, “It kind of has the resonance of Columbus discovering America.…That is, a newcomer sort of not understanding there was actually a thriving population already existing in the area and thinking that this is a barren wasteland on which to build something new” (Dubb, 2017). With housing prices going up in the University Park neighborhood, people with money, who tend to be white, are moving into low income neighborhoods, while low income locals, who tend to be people of color, are getting pushed out. 
	As is characteristic of gentrification, people of the middle class alienate the less fortunate; in this case, cheaper vendors are relegated to the streets outside Mercado La Paloma. Instead of providing a space where all people can come together, as the Mercado believes it has, the marketplace segregates people of different classes. The prime example of a cheaper vendor assigned to the streets is a fruit stand located on the parking lot of Mercado La Paloma. The contrast between the interior of the marketplace and this street stand is stark. While the inside of the market is clean, spacious, and deliberately decorated, the fruit stand consists of a metal cart on wheels. Moreover, two umbrellas, one of which is haphazardly stuck into a bucket of concrete, give the stand limited shade. The contrast between this small fruit stand, physically relegated to the outskirts, and the Mercado La Paloma truly is a microcosm for the widespread gentrification in University Park. Additionally, although the fruit stand’s location means that it could capitalize on customers going to the marketplace, the stand does not have a lot of customers. At any given time, the stand had at most one customer; most of the time, however, people would simply walk by. This lack of business supports the point that Mercado La Paloma is meant for the middle class and not the varied population the market had proposed. If the customers of the market were truly socioeconomically diverse, the stand would attract more customers. 
	Mercado La Paloma is a University Park marketplace that outwardly seems like a haven from gentrification, but in actuality embodies it. This was likely not the intention of the founders of Mercado La Paloma, however, and it is evident that avoiding gentrification while developing low income areas is difficult. How can one possibly maintain the integrity of a commercial venture while also accounting for the lives of the people that live in the community? How can policies be put in place to prevent gentrification? How can a business contain its impact on a neighborhood? Ideally, the goal for a business in University Park would be for the neighborhood to remain unchanged; however, this is improbable. The reality is that commercial development in at-risk areas and gentrification are inextricably intertwined, and the estrangement of the lower-class locals has no easy solution. Unlike my high school, who can most definitely end our relationship with our brother school, Mercado La Paloma cannot just cut ties with its problems.
