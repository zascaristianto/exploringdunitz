From its very beginning, downtown Los Angeles, aka. DTLA, has taken many forms: after being acquired from Mexico, it started as a settlement for the explorers from the east coast, then turned into a transportation center for the transcontinental railway, then an industrial center producing war-time equipment during WWII and shifted the business and cultural center for a rapid-expanding region in the 20th century. Role after role, the area has acquired different characteristics from different times, as well as holding a population consisted of different races, traditions, and ideals. From the late 20th century till present, the area is under a new series of changes: DTLA is planned to take back the center of Southern California with a modern urban experience of living, working and entertaining. This seemingly beneficial proposal, however, was not that welcomed by the everyone. A new round of conflicts emerges between the renovation plan of downtown Los Angeles and the local residents in terms of community reforming. Being a neighborhood full of diversity, DTLA embraces a population consisted of different ethnicity and occupations and serves multiple roles in the region, yet it also bears a growing contrast between the rich and the poor. The recent renovation plans facilitate gentrification, a reshaping of the neighborhood that brought in the relocation of low-income residents, overwhelming hostile designs, loss of public spaces, and the slow demolition of the local artist community. In response to a more crowded and unfriendly downtown, the local residents are using bold and vital art as a revolt against the new public policies.

 Los Angeles is a city strong in diversity, and when it comes to diversity, one may first think of the variety of races. If you just look at the names of the neighborhoods around the city center, it won’t be hard to find the trace of different ethnics: Chinatown, Korean Town, Little Tokyo, Filipino town, etc. The census data provided by LA Times indicated that the DTLA population is made up of 21.3% Asian, 22.3% Black, 36.7% Latino, 16.2% White and 3.3% of other races. It also points out that the DTLA population is “highly diverse for the city of Los Angeles and highly diverse for the century.” (L.A. Times, 2008) The census data shows the population of DTLA is significantly diverse in terms of races. Besides the diversity in races, the people in DTLA also embraces different walks of life. According to the 2018 Downtown Los Angeles Survey, the DTLA workforce is “highly diversified, with eight industries employing at least 5% of the workforce”. People who live in DTLA mainly works in the arts and entertainment (18%), business and professional services (14%) and educational services, while the entire workforce mostly concentrates on business and financial industries (adds up to 36%). (DCBID, 2018) From these datasets, we can see that downtown LA is highly diverse, both in terms of ethnicity and occupations. Beyond these, there are other aspects to take into account as well: lifestyle, tradition, believes, etc. To understand the reason behind such diversity in DTLA, one must look into the strategic planning of the downtown area.
 
 While the diversity on DTLA has filled the city center with a rich historical background and a vital culture, the lack of planning and the tension between communities also caused social turmoil in the area. A major breakout took place in April 1992, when people of different races and backgrounds compete against each other openly for spaces in the city. These events “unleashed a complex outpouring of public concerns, involving a number of different ethnic and social groups.”(Crawford, 1995) The riots raised concerns in discrimination, class inequity and security in DTLA, and drove the city governors to take action. The Downtown Strategic Plan of Los Angeles, 1993, defined the role of DTLA with several titles: “the employment center”, “a major revenue generator”, “the industrial heart”, “the central focus (in terms of regional transit)”, “the regional government center”, “the region’s center of history and culture”, “a developing new residential base” and “the largest resource of SRO Housing and social services in the region”. The plan also gave a detailed guideline to redeveloping the area, which includes defining specific functionalities for different parts of the area, strengthening connections within neighborhoods, increasing educational opportunities and enforcing security measures. (DTLA Strategic Plan Advisory Committee, 1993). The plan aimed at renovating Los Angeles into a modern city of balance and charting a course for future development to bring more space and community cooperation. Currently, DTLA has satisfied some of these goals set improved its experience for visitors, workers and new residents. However, there are still social problems that remain unsolved in the region and among those problems, the contrast between the life quality of the rich and the poor may well be the most serious one.
 
 Life in DTLA seems to be enjoyable for those who can afford it. The time-worn business center of the west coast has lately become a favorite for high-end housing, shopping, and entertainment. Numerous corporations and business build skyscrapers for their office, making up the skyline of DTLA, which are followed by luxurious hotels along with high-end shopping centers and entertainment revenues. In the shadow of the dazzling city, however, lies the hard life of the local residents. Although DTLA is not a district originally designed for residential purposes, there are still more than thirty thousand people living in the area, struggling with the relatively “low income in the city and in the country”. (LA Times, 2008) The residents also bear a higher divorce rate and a lower education level, comparing to other parts of LA, and the real situation might be worse: the data doesn’t take into consideration of the homeless people, which in Skid Row alone has reached an estimation of 2500 in 2005 with a trend of rising(CRA/LA). Such a contrast between the living standards of the area and the actual life qualities of the residence is significant in the scope of the country, and even around the globe. The contrast clearly illustrates the imbalance of growth in downtown LA, as the business and consumerism continue to flourish, leaving the local residents coping with a higher requirement to match the living cost and less space for them to live and relax. The tension between different classes has grown fiercer in recent years, as a more rapid and drastic wave of modifications is taking place in the area, in the name of “gentrification”.
 
 Gentrification refers to the process of renovating a neighborhood by replacing or furnishing older buildings and infrastructures in order to fit the taste of residents of a higher class. While gentrification can potentially attract business and new residents, it’s a change that the local residents usually don’t want to see.
 
"A wide array of research has shown gentrification to be harmful, including increased cost of living, depletion of neighborhood place-identity, homelessness, community conflict and, critically, the purported direct and indirect displacement of low-income groups and their attendant landscapes (qt. in DeVerteuil, 2011)."

Such analysis has revealed the damage gentrification can bring to the native residents, who cannot afford the rising living cost and have to move out of their current living spaces. The DTLA area is currently under the process of gentrification, which could be proved by the relocation of social services that support the population of low or no income. From the ten-year study on gentrification induced relocation of social services done by DeVerteuil, 17 social service agencies/organizations felt the displacement pressure from gentrification for various reasons, of which 7 organization was dislocated (DeVerteuil, 2011). DeVerteuil also pointed out that such dislocation is largely involuntary, and the force behind the dislocation is usually involved with the government trying to squeeze the low-income population out of the center of DTLA alongside with all the shelters and camps (2011). Without the support of these social service groups, low-income residents and the homeless have no choice but to move with these organizations or seek a place to live in harsher environments.

While low-income residents are being pushed out of the city center, those who have survived the relocation now face another problem: the overwhelming presence of hostile design and the loss of public spaces. Hostile design refers to designs that specifically want to exclude certain groups of people or behaviors from using the object. Originally used in private properties, such design has extended its color to public spaces where governors use to keep people from occupying or altering the space (Perrson, 2017). It turns out that today’s DTLA, which is supposed to have “a framework of civic open spaces that provide necessary and suitable settings for public life”, has silently applied a considerable number of hostile designs to its public spaces.

The hostile designs in Los Angeles have two common goals. One of which is to keep off the homeless population from the spaces and prevent people from occupying the spaces for too long. The other is to prevent certain activities, such as skateboarding, playing sports and parkouring in open areas. Aiming to keep the open spaces in order, these designs actually restricted the usage of local citizens in using public spaces. Meanwhile, the progress the city government makes on creating more open spaces is not satisfying. In a detailed analysis of DTLA public space development, researchers revealed:

“… the city’s planning department has very little to do with planning in downtown. Seemingly they have yielded to the redevelopment decisions of the community redevelopment agency, which has yet to prepare any overall guidelines or plan.” (Loukaitou-Sideris & Banerjee, 1993)

The result of such a decision is that the public spaces in DTLA are disconnected from each other, with each of these areas following their own rule and concepts. Even one City Redevelopment Agency director has expressed his pessimistic view over the public spaces development in DTLA, claiming it to have “a lot of pressures and problems” as well as “a general unwillingness from the part of the businessmen to help accomplish a sound environment.” (Loukaitou-Sideris & Banerjee, 1993) With more and more spaces being occupied by hostile design and lack an efficient organization, residents are experiencing a severe loss of available open spaces, which can lead to a decrease in community involvement and ways to communicate and entertain.

The spreading of gentrification has brought problems for the artist population as well. Located south-east to the main downtown area, the Artist District is home to more than two thousand people. To avoid the high rent and living costs in the Venice neighborhood, a lot of artists came to settle in the area in the late 20th century, transforming the abandoned industrial buildings and warehouses into their homes and workspace. Recently, however, the rising rent prices in the district are once again forcing them to leave. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, rents in the Arts District rose by 140 percent in some cases between 2000 and 2014. (as qt. in Cohrs, 2016). This is mainly due to the expansion of the real estate business, along with pricier restaurants and shopping places moving into the area, raising the land value of the neighborhood. The changes might be good for the district to attract residents and businesses, but they have pushed the artists into a catch twenty-two: they do not have the sufficient money to get more space and expand their work, but their current income is not able to support the higher rents. On the other hand, the artists' community itself is facing a new challenge. The artists rely on a close-knit community to develop ideas and support each other, yet recently this community base is in grave danger. In a study regarding the change of Art District, researcher Lindsey Miller stated that “as property and land values have soared, some of the older buildings in the neighborhood are threatened with demolition.” She listed several important buildings in the district that was torn down or closed in the 21st century, including the Al’s Bar, a center of activities in the early Arts District and the Old Pickle Factory building which has been home to the new artists in the area since the 1980s. Also gone are the shops and groceries that serves the community but cannot afford the growing rent rates (Miller, 2014). The buildings torn down were replaced by higher-end housing and restaurants or became a part of a larger development project. These “renovation plans” slowly undermines the neighborhood by taking away its key components and culture. Eventually, the artists will find themselves strangled in the new environment, losing their access to affordable goods, community interaction, and working spaces. Without a supportive neighborhood, the artists may have no choice but to search for new grounds farther away from the city center.

The local residents in downtown Los Angeles have suffered from a less welcoming neighborhood. However, people seem not to lose hope in defending their traditional habitat. One of the ways the DTLA people applied to show their determination is through art. Since a large portion of the local residents pursues an art career, the DTLA area has never lost a vital spirit of artistic expression, especially in a hard time like this. If you take a casual walk in downtown LA, you will find yourself surrounded by art produced by the local people, most likely by murals, a popular way for the local artists the share their emotions and creativity.

The mural atmosphere has long been a history in the Los Angeles city, especially in the Downtown area. From the Robin Dunitz California and Los Angeles Mural Files (up to 2002), at least 30 murals of cultural importance created in the late 20th century and early 21st century were located in the DTLA area, including the Victor Clothing Co. mural collections, the Stamps of Victory, and Undiscovered America. Even though some of the murals have disappeared due to the demolition of the buildings or wall replacement, a lot of these murals persists until today. The Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles has listed more than 140 recognized murals currently existing in DTLA, and there are more unnamed works created by street artists and art communities. The murals cover almost every space in Los Angeles: walls, sidewalks, freeways, warehouses… and varies largely in scale, style, and topic. Some of the murals were completed under government sponsorship, while others were produced with the help of artist communities and art organizations such as the Social and Public Art Resource Center (the SPARC), who have been supporting artists on public art projects and renovation and preservation of the murals since 1976. Unlike gallery or museum art, the murals fulfill the spirit of public art -- “art is for everyone” – by presenting enormous pictures directly to its viewers. The murals have revealed DTLA residents’ passion for art as well as their devotion to the local community.

The presence of the murals is not a recent addition to the community. What has changed are the topics and ideas these murals embed. Many new murals in the area side with a new round of activism, a revolt against the city policies and gentrification taking place in the neighborhood. These art forms have gone beyond traditional murals. In a recent research done by A. Moras and K. Dastiridou (2015), the two researchers gave a list of noticeable public art work in Skid Row and the Arts District that openly stand against the ongoing changes:
The artist Wild Life hacked Downtown L.A. signs to point to ‘Hipsters’ and ‘Gentrification’ as if they were DTLA areas and Calder Greenwood planted paper mache sunbathers in an undeveloped for a long time downtown lot… a collaboration of the aforementioned artists set[s] up a scene of idyllic houses with cardboards (the basic material the homeless use as a mattress) that wrote Skid Row Estates in calligraphy on top against the backside of the historic Skid Row firehouse.

Dastiridou (2015)

The murals, bearing a bold and energetic mind of revolt, have illustrated the determination of the local residents in defending their homelands against real estate and government forces who are trying to occupy these spaces. They also revealed a conflict between the people and the public policy, where the strategic plans of renovation contradict with the actual needs of the people.



The goal of creating a sustainable society cannot be achieved without embracing people of all classes, occupations, and ethnicity. Despite the rapid changes in downtown Los Angeles to attract visitors and new residents, the conflict between the local residents and the renovation plans remains to be solved. More and more construction sites are cleaning up the timely buildings, bringing in more shopping centers and pricey residential buildings. With the living conditions worsening day by day, the local residents still strive to live on. The art they created as counterculture has shown us their creativity as well as their determination in protecting their living spaces and their community. Their efforts are not unheard. The discussion upon gentrification and its potential impact have raised concern in the general public. As more and more research and reports on the downtown development being released, the policies regarding downtown development are currently under reconsideration. Nonetheless, many have acknowledged the capability of Los Angeles people to construct the ideal downtown. “LA has the physical space and potentially the political will to craft a downtown geared toward all sorts of people so that a young lawyer might actually reside next to a formerly homeless resident, Southern California Institute of Architecture student, or social worker.” (Sindzinski, 2017) It’s all lied in the hands of LA’s citizens whether DTLA can be rebuilt into a community of equity and love, a city center that if for everyone.
